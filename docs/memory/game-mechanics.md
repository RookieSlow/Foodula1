# Game Mechanics

This document records the mechanics represented by the current code. Values
may be overridden by the active `GameConfigSO` asset or by loaded track JSON.

## Turn and Card Loop

- Each player has a draw pile, hand, discard pile, and independent engine
  heat pool.
- The default hand limit is 7.
- The default speed deck contains twelve cards:
  `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.
- Three heat cards start in the deck by default.
- A turn selects a gear from 1 through 4 and plays speed cards.
- The selected speed-card values determine movement.
- Played speed cards enter the discard pile; the discard pile is reshuffled
  when the draw pile is empty.
- Heat cards cannot be played as speed cards and can clog the hand.

## Gear and Cooling Rules

- The selected gear controls how many speed cards may be played.
- A normal shift changes one gear.
- A two-gear shift costs heat.
- Gear 1 removes up to three heat cards from the hand.
- Gear 2 removes up to one heat card from the hand.
- Higher gears provide no automatic cooling.

Gear-shift heat cost and gear-one/gear-two cooling values are configured in
`GameConfigSO`. `MVPGameManager` resolves these rules through `RaceRules` for
both the player and AI race flow.

## Heat

- Each player starts with an independent engine heat pool of 6 by default.
- Overspeeding through corners, sudden braking, and engine failures can move
  heat cards from the engine pool into the deck/discard lifecycle.
- Cooling returns heat cards from the hand to the engine pool.
- Running out of payable engine heat affects the race flow according to the
  current manager rules.

The earlier "Cold Storage below zero" description belongs to the original
prototype and is no longer the authoritative model.

## Track and Race

- The Race scene currently loads the 60-node, 3-lap Silverstone JSON track;
  a 42-node hard-coded track remains as a fallback only.
- When `GameConfigSO.trackId` is populated, `TrackManager` loads
  `Resources/Configs/Tracks/<trackId>.json`.
- JSON tracks may define their own node count, lap count, start/finish node,
  corners, apex cells, speed limits, pit entry/exit, weather pool, and layout.
- Corner-speed resolution triggers only when movement crosses an `isApex`
  cell. Repeated apex cells for the same corner are deduplicated per move.
- Player initialization and lap crossing use the runtime node marked
  `isStartFinish`, including when that node is not index 0.
- HUD position totals and LineRenderer coordinates use the loaded track data.
- Track presentation uses the selected layout background in Play Mode, with
  translucent yellow corner masks, red apex masks, and visible speed-limit
  labels. Runtime grid nodes, lane lines, and debug corner text are hidden;
  tracks with explicit lane-specific limits show the effective limit above each
  lane's apex. Editor Scene view retains node metadata and limits for authoring.
  Ordinary tracks place all cars on the inside lane by default; when cars share
  the same lap and node, the stable-order trailing car uses the outside lane
  for the side-by-side visual. This is presentation-only: gameplay positions,
  corner checks, lap counts, camera framing, and minimap tracking are unchanged.
  Indianapolis keeps explicit per-car lane choices, and the player's start/finish
  lane selection immediately repositions the player car.
- On `indianapolis_burger`, corner limits are lane-specific from inner to outer:
  `4/5/6/7`; in the Unity path data lane 0 is the inside lane and lane 3 is
  the outside lane, so the outer lane accommodates a speed total well above 4
  before overspeed heat. At each start/finish crossing, the player may move one
  lane inward, keep the current lane, or move one lane outward; boundary
  choices are disabled and the AI keeps its lane.
- Authoring workflow, vehicle orientation, pit behavior, weather integration,
  and a full multi-lap manual playthrough remain incomplete.

## Opponents and Win Condition

- The current demo includes the player and one AI-controlled opponent.
- AI speed-card selection uses configurable normal, heat-warning, and
  corner-risk behavior. Its variation probability and random source are
  injectable so seeded runs can be reproduced in tests.
- A race ends when a participant reaches the configured lap count.
- Final ranking compares completed laps and track position.

## Drivers

- The main menu exposes a session-only driver selection panel with two drivers
  for each of the six national teams.
- Each `PlayerState` stores a driver catalog ID and XP. The selected driver
  supplies the player's team for race initialization; an unset selection uses
  the configured team's first catalog entry.
- Driver progression uses cumulative XP thresholds `0/100/250/500/1000/2000/4000`
  for levels 1 through 7. Passive tiers unlock at levels 2/4/6 and active
  tiers at levels 3/5/7. Level 7 provides two active uses per race; the UK
  team adds one extra active use.
- `DriverData.cs` currently provides the immutable catalog and structured skill
  descriptions. Signature-skill runtime effects are intentionally not applied
  to movement yet; those effects need a separate rules slice and tests.
